How do I verify that my traffic is using VPNÂ¶

There are many ways of doing this, and I welcome you to add to this list if you have any suggestions.

You can exec into the container and through the shell use curl to ask for your public IP. There are multiple endpoints for this but here are a few suggestions:
    curl http://ipinfo.io/ip
    curl http://ipecho.net/plain
    curl icanhazip.com

Or you could use a test torrent service to download a torrent file and then you can get the IP from that tracker.

It is a virtual network so you need to look up the ips.
localhost does not work

sudo docker ps
-- get the CONTAINER ID
sudo docker inspect <CONTAINER ID>
--  get the ip address
